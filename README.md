## 🎯 Featured Agent Workflows

### 🏗️ **Multi-Agent Development Project**
```bash
# Orchestrator analyzes requirements and assembles optimal team
@agent-organizer "Build authentication system with social login"

# Result: Coordinates backend-architect, security-auditor, frontend-developer, api-documenter
# Each agent works in parallel with shared context awareness
```

### 📊 **Automated Sprint Management**
```bash
# AI Scrum Master with sub-agent ecosystem
@ai-scrum-master "Set up automated sprint management"

# Features:
# • 3-hour standup cycles with progress tracking
# • Intelligent blocker detection and escalation
# • Sprint analytics and velocity monitoring
# • Automated reporting to stakeholders
```

### 🔍 **Comprehensive Code Review**
```bash
# Multi-dimensional code analysis
@code-reviewer "Review authentication implementation"

# Includes:
# • Security vulnerability assessment
# • Performance bottleneck analysis  
# • Code quality and maintainability
# • Testing coverage validation
```

## 🏛️ Architecture & Communication

### **Agent Communication Protocol**

Every agent follows a **mandatory three-phase protocol**:

1. **Context Acquisition** → Query `context-manager` for project state
2. **Task Execution** → Perform specialized work with context awareness  
3. **Activity Reporting** → Report completion for team coordination

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "react-pro",
  "request_type": "get_task_briefing", 
  "payload": {
    "query": "React project context and recent component work"
  }
}
```

### **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integrations**

Agents access specialized tools and services:

- **🔍 context7**: Library documentation and research
- **✨ magic**: Component generation and design systems
- **🧠 sequential-thinking**: Complex analysis workflows
- **🌐 playwright**: Browser automation and testing
